# Repy-Defensive-Security-Monitor
This project implements a reference monitor that oversees file operations in Repy. In addition to the default Repy behavior, the monitor adds support for a default file to be used when files are opened without creating them first. This defense monitor ensures that program follows certain rules, preventing potential unauthorized actions.
There are two versions. The first version is the reference monitor that was used in a red-team blue-team simulation. It enforces file constraints. This reference monitor had a 80% defense rate against attacks. The second version is the updated version, with new changes integrated to the reference monitor.
