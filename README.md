# Repy-Defensive-Security-Monitor
This project implements a reference monitor that oversees file operations in Repy. In addition to the default Repy behavior, the monitor adds support for a default file to be used when files are opened without creating them first. This defense monitor ensures that program follows certain rules, preventing potential unauthorized actions.
